# Note:

"""
The -e . command used with pip install installs a Python package in "editable" mode, with the dot . specifying 
the current directory. This mode allows developers to make changes to the package's source code and see the effects 
immediately, without reinstalling the package. It's especially useful for ongoing development, enabling real-time
testing of modifications. The -e flag signifies that the installation is editable, linking it directly to the 
source code for easy updates.
